## Why Nuxt PDF Kit?

Building a PDF viewer in Nuxt requires dealing with:

- **PDF.js complexity** - Understanding and configuring the PDF.js library
- **SSR issues** - Handling client-only components and hydration
- **UI development** - Creating a responsive, accessible interface from scratch
- **Feature implementation** - Adding search, zoom, print, download, and more

**Nuxt PDF Kit** solves all of these problems by providing:
